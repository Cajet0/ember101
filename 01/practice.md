# Your site

Write an static application with 3 pages.

* An index page with path `/`, that will show your name. (Ex: Benito Serna)
* An about page with path `/about`, to write something about you. (Ex: I ember apps)
* A contact page with on `/my-contact-data`, to write your email. (Ex: bhserna@gmail.com)


### Bonus:

Add a navbar with three links:

* "Home" that will send you to '/'
* "About" that will send you to '/about'
* "Contact" that will send you to '/my-contact-data'
