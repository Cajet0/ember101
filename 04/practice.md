# Cars list

Write an application that shows information about diferente car models.

This is the cars info:

```js
var cars = [
  { name: "Focus", company: "Ford" },
  { name: "Compass", company: "Jeep" },
  { name: "Corolla", company: "Toyota" },
  { name: "March", company: "Nissan" }
]
```

## Cars master - detail

* When I go to the root path
* I should see a list with the cars names in the sidebar
* And the detail (company) of the first car (Focus)
* When I click to a car name
* Then that car should be selected
* And the detail of that car should be shown
